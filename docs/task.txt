The goal of the task is to create a shipment and download the shipping label for the courier broker.
As a base file for further work, you should use the spring.php file, which has been filled with basic parameters necessary for creating a shipment
and downloading the label, as well as fictitious address data for the recipient and sender.

The function named newPackage() creating a shipment should accept specific parameters:
newPackage(array $order, array $params) - where:
 - $order is an associative array containing all address information necessary for creating a shipment (mainly recipient and sender data)
 - $params is an associative array containing all additional information necessary for creating a shipment and generating a label (API key, service, etc.)
In case of failure during shipment creation, the function should return and display a readable error from the API in the browser.

The function named packagePDF() returning the shipment label should accept specific parameters:
packagePDF(string $trackingNumber)
 - $trackingNumber is a string storing the shipment number returned by the newPackage() function
The function should return and display a readable error from the API in the browser in case of failure or 'spit out' the shipping label in the browser in 'save' mode.

Additional information:
 When writing code (including division into classes/methods), follow the "KISS principle" rule
 Code should be as simple as possible and consist of the smallest number of files: preferably one file with a courier class and another file creating an object and calling methods
 Pay attention to character limits in delivery address fields and handle them
 Handling any errors returned by the API (including connection errors) is very important (checking data coming in the newPackage function parameter can be omitted) - during testing of your task we will use various incorrect API parameters to verify the content/quality of messages returned to the browser
 Only use functions/classes built into PHP
 PSR-12 coding standard
 Spend as much time on the task as you want/need
